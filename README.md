# Text-Encrypt-Decryptor
A simple text encryptor decryptor using Assembly. can be improved later to file encryptor  because the same logic will be implemented
2 different approaches:
Where the first code will  decrypt the text which were encrypted
Meanwhile, the second will just   output the inputted text as a decrypted text.
