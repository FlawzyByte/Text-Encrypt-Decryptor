# Text-Encrypt-Decryptor
A simple text encryptor decryptor in Assembly. 
Can be improved later to file encryptor since the same logic will be implemented.
2 different approaches:
Where the first code will  decrypt the text which were encrypted
Meanwhile, the second will just output the inputted text as a decrypted text.
